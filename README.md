# mirnabraineqtl

This repository contains the code necessary to run the analyses in Insight Into Genetic Regulation of miRNA in Mouse Brain.  The RMD files should be ran in the following order:

The order of eQTL_target_genes,hotspot_analysis, phenotype_analysis, and bayesian_network_analysis does not matter.  Due to the file size, the mRNA expression data resides at PhenoGen.org.  The data can be found on the "Available Data Downloads" page under the Publications tab and going to the Processed Data section designated for, "Predictive Modeling of miRNA-mediated Predisposition to Alcohol-related Phenotypes in Mouse." The file is titled, "mRNA_expression_data_full.csv.zip."  Please use this data in place of the data titled, "Adjusted_rma.summary.txt."
