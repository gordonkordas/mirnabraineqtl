# mirnabraineqtl

This repository contains the code necessary to run the analyses in Insight Into Genetic Regulation of miRNA in Mouse Brain.  The RMD files should be ran in the following order:

1. eQTL_cleaning
2. eQTL_analysis
3. miRNA locations
4. eQTL_evaluation
5. eQTL_evaluation_graphics
6. eQTL_target_genes
7. hotspot_analysis
8. bayesian_network_analysis
9. phenotype_analysis
10.miRNA_paper_figures

The order of files 6 through 10 does not really matter.
